- Conducted data cleaning, processing, and visualization on population data to facilitate analysis and derive insights.

Key Achievements:
   1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
       - Imported and processed population data from an Excel file with 67 rows and 8 columns
       - Standardized column names to English and numeric formats for consistency and clarity
       - Removed non-functional rows and handled missing values effectively, ensuring data integrity
       - Separated combined Japanese and English city names into distinct columns for better readability and analysis

   2. Data Transformation:
       - Added a new column to classify municipalities as City, Town, Village, or County based on their names
       - Converted population-related columns to integer data types to maintain numerical accuracy
       - Reorganized data columns to improve structure and readability for further analysis

   3. Data Visualization:
       - Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to create visualizations, highlighting the distribution and trends in population data
       - Developed count plots to show the number of cities, towns, and villages
       -  Created strip plots to compare population sizes across different municipal classifications

    Tools and Technologies:
        Python: Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
        Excel for initial data handling and verification
